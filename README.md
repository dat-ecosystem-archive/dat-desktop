## FAQ

### How can I speed up downloading Electron?
If youâ€™re Europe / US you might want to use a different mirror for `electron`.
You can set the `ELECTRON_MIRROR` variable to point to a different provider:
```sh
# Europe / US
$ npm install

# Asia / Oceania
$ ELECTRON_MIRROR="https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/electron/" npm install
```
